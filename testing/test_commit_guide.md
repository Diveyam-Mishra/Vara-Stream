# How to Test Your Commit Analysis

## üöÄ Make a Test Commit to 2D-OS

### Option 1: Simple File Change
```bash
# Navigate to your 2D-OS repository
cd /path/to/2D-OS

# Make a small change
echo "// Testing AI commit analysis - $(date)" >> test-analysis.js

# Commit and push
git add test-analysis.js
git commit -m "Test: AI commit analysis system"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Meaningful Code Change
```bash
# Edit an existing file with a real improvement
# For example, add error handling to a component:

// In src/components/Dashboard.tsx
const Dashboard = () => {
  try {
    // existing code...
    return <div>Dashboard content</div>;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Dashboard error:', error);
    return <div>Error loading dashboard</div>;
  }
};
```

## üìç Where to Find Results (In Order of Appearance)

### 1. **Webhook Server Logs** (Immediate - 2-5 seconds)
Watch your terminal where `github_webhook.py` is running:
```
2025-08-15 23:45:12 - Received GitHub event: push
2025-08-15 23:45:13 - Processing push to 2D-OS at refs/heads/main
2025-08-15 23:45:14 - Fetching enhanced commit data for abc123def
2025-08-15 23:45:15 - Starting analysis workflow for abc123def
2025-08-15 23:45:18 - AI Analysis complete: Quality 92/100
2025-08-15 23:45:19 - Set final commit status to 'success'
```

### 2. **GitHub Commit Page** (30-60 seconds)
- Go to: https://github.com/Diveyam-Mishra/2D-OS/commits
- Click your latest commit
- Look for status checks below the commit message
- You'll see: ‚úÖ **gemini-commit-analysis** - Code analysis passed!

### 3. **Detailed Results API** (Available immediately after analysis)
Visit: `http://localhost:8000/analysis/Diveyam-Mishra/2D-OS/[your-commit-sha]`

Replace `[your-commit-sha]` with your actual commit SHA (first 8+ characters)

Example: `http://localhost:8000/analysis/Diveyam-Mishra/2D-OS/abc123def`

## üéØ What You'll See in Each Location

### GitHub Status Check:
- ‚úÖ **Success**: "Code analysis passed! Quality: 92/100"
- ‚ùå **Failure**: "Code needs improvement. Quality: 65/100"
- ‚è≥ **Pending**: "Analyzing commit with Gemini AI..."

### API Endpoint Response:
```json
{
  "repo": "Diveyam-Mishra/2D-OS",
  "commit_id": "abc123def456789",
  "analysis": {
    "code_quality_score": 92.0,
    "security_score": 88.0,
    "feature_implementation_score": 85.0,
    "architectural_impact": 75,
    "completion_percentage": 89.5,
    "confidence": 85,
    "analysis_summary": "High-quality commit with good security practices...",
    "recommendations": [
      "Consider adding TypeScript interfaces",
      "Add error handling for async operations"
    ]
  }
}
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If you don't see results:
1. **Check webhook server logs** - Is it receiving the webhook?
2. **Check GitHub webhook settings** - Is the webhook configured correctly?
3. **Check API endpoint** - Visit the direct URL to see if analysis completed
4. **Check GitHub App installation** - Is the app installed on your repo?

### Common Issues:
- **No webhook received**: Check your ngrok/tunnel URL in GitHub webhook settings
- **Analysis fails**: Check Google API key in .env file
- **No GitHub status**: Check RSA key and GitHub App permissions

## üéâ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when you see:
1. ‚úÖ **Webhook logs** showing "Analysis complete"
2. ‚úÖ **GitHub status check** on your commit
3. ‚úÖ **API endpoint** returning detailed analysis
4. ‚úÖ **No errors** in webhook server logs

Happy testing! üöÄ
