# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GitHub commit analysis system currently cannot fetch information from GitHub due to missing or incomplete GitHub API integration. This feature will establish proper GitHub API connectivity, authentication, and data fetching capabilities to enable the system to retrieve commit data, repository information, and other necessary GitHub resources for comprehensive commit analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the GitHub API client to properly authenticate with GitHub, so that the system can access repository data and commit information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate GitHub App credentials from environment variables
2. WHEN GitHub App credentials are missing THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages and fail gracefully
3. WHEN authenticating with GitHub THEN the system SHALL generate valid JWT tokens using the GitHub App private key
4. WHEN accessing a repository THEN the system SHALL obtain installation access tokens for that specific repository
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the authentication issue

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to fetch comprehensive commit data from GitHub, so that the analysis workflow has complete information about code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a webhook event THEN the system SHALL extract commit SHA, repository information, and basic commit metadata
2. WHEN analyzing a commit THEN the system SHALL fetch the complete commit diff/patch data from GitHub API
3. WHEN retrieving commit data THEN the system SHALL handle pagination for commits with many changed files
4. WHEN API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL implement proper backoff and retry mechanisms
5. IF commit data cannot be retrieved THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with available data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want proper error handling and logging for GitHub API interactions, so that I can troubleshoot integration issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including status codes and response messages
2. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL log rate limit information and wait appropriately
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
4. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh tokens and retry the request
5. IF persistent errors occur THEN the system SHALL alert administrators through appropriate logging channels

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to retrieve repository context information, so that commit analysis can consider the broader codebase structure and history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a commit THEN the system SHALL fetch repository metadata including language, size, and description
2. WHEN processing commits THEN the system SHALL retrieve file content for modified files to understand changes in context
3. WHEN analyzing architecture impact THEN the system SHALL fetch repository structure and key configuration files
4. WHEN evaluating test coverage THEN the system SHALL identify and retrieve test files related to changed code
5. IF repository context cannot be retrieved THEN the system SHALL proceed with commit-only analysis

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want flexible configuration options for GitHub integration, so that the system can work with different GitHub setups and environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN it SHALL support both GitHub App authentication and personal access tokens
2. WHEN working with GitHub Enterprise THEN the system SHALL allow custom GitHub API base URLs
3. WHEN deploying in different environments THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configuration
4. WHEN testing locally THEN the system SHALL provide mock/test modes that don't require real GitHub access
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation messages during startup
